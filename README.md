**Your phone screen is boring. Let's make it undead.**

Tired of static backgrounds? UndeadWallpaper is a free, balls-to-the-wall Android app that brings your screen to life... or, well, *un-death* by letting you slap any of your favorite videos on it as a seamless, stutter-free live wallpaper.

## The Story Behind the Name

This isn't just a clever pun on "live" wallpaper. The name **UndeadWallpaper** is personal. After a long, forced hiatus from coding, this project was the first sign of life‚Äîthe moment a passion that was buried came clawing its way back to the surface. This app isn't just "live"; it's a symbol of a creator coming back from the dead. It's **undead**, because some things are just too stubborn to die.

## Features ‚ú®

*   **Buttery-Smooth Looping:** Powered by ExoPlayer, your video loops will be so seamless, you'll forget where they even begin (oÀò‚ó°Àòo).
*   **Unleash Your Own Videos:** No pre-packaged crap. Grab any video straight from your phone's storage and make it your backdrop.
*   **Quick-Draw Recents:** A handy list of your last-used videos, so you can swap vibes on the fly.
*   **Audio On/Off Toggle:** Want your wallpaper to make some noise? Flip the switch. Want silent beauty? We got you.
*   **100% Free & Open Source:** No ads, no bullshit, no microtransactions. Ever. This is a passion project, and the code is open for all you brilliant weirdos to see.

## Getting Started (It's scary simple)

1.  **Pick Your Poison:** Tap the "Pick Video" button and choose your masterpiece.
2.  **Smash the Button:** Like what you see in the preview? Hit that floating button and bring your screen to glorious un-life.

This project clawed its way back from the dead, but it was the **community** that truly gave it a soul. The launch on Reddit was a whirlwind of incredible feedback, brilliant ideas, and amazing support. It's where the next chapter of this story is being written.
